Cathub is a new level 7 free and keyless executor that has a easy gui and is fast using injection.
Cathub is still in progress so join https://discord.gg/PgpW3Ba8 for updates.
If it is patched use Solara or Nova executor.
Solara: https://github.com/RobloxExecutorz/Solara or https://discord.gg/getsolara
Nova: https://discord.gg/MWXcwF9J


How to install
First install it on github
if you cant install on chrome, get microsoft edge. It will say its a virus because its a executor. Executors like fluxus also do it.
next, run the exe and wait 10 secs
once it loads you should see the gui. You need the microsoft version of roblox.
Once you do, load it in and press inject.
Congrats, you installed cathub!
