Cathub is a new level 7 free and keyless executor that has a easy gui and is fast using injection.
Cathub is still in progress so join https://discord.gg/PgpW3Ba8 for updates.
If it is patched use Solara or Nova executor.
Solara: https://github.com/RobloxExecutorz/Solara or https://discord.gg/getsolara
Nova: https://discord.gg/MWXcwF9J

How to install
First install it on github
next press the exe
you will see a warning but just click run away since window's antivirus thinks executors are a virus (it also does it for fluxus)
wait ten secs
the gui should pop up
ALSO, it only uses the microsoft roblox version, make sure you get that
